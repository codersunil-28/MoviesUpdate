This app:
Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:

A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
user rating (called vote_average in the api)

Allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
Allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).
